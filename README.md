# Fake News Detection

Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. Fake news often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity or making money through advertising revenue. In this project, I have performed fake news detection using LSTM. The dataset has been obtained from Kaggle. It consists of around 17k+ real articles and 20k+ fake articles. I have preprocessed the data, tokenized it, and normalized the corpus. Next, I trained an LSTM model and achieved over 99% accuracy on both validation and test data.
